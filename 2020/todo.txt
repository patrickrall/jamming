Tiled Integration:
    - associate image clip with Tiled id number
    - draw tile layer
    - draw objects
    - parse object properties, populate classes

    - understand Tiled collision detection on tile layer
    - understand Tiled propensity for movements
	


Performance testing
    - many objects by translation
    - all in the same vbuffer
    - all in separate vbuffers
    - with merged / unmerged preamble
    - movement by reloading buffer / translation
