Writing Development:
Designing an interesting civilization is easy, but designing a star system that
is interesting visually and for gameplay, and the resulting geology and culture
was a fun challenge that took flexibility and creativity. The characters that
sprang from the lore, and the quest lines that had to drive the player all
across the galaxy, was time consuming, but a robust quest-display and tracking 
architecture made parallelization very convenient. The quests could be more
detailed, and the flow could be better streamlined, but what we finished creates
an atmosphere of chaos and endless options that matches the calm Orbits vibe.
