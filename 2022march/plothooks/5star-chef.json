{"plot summary":
	"On Bass: Chef Maurice LeStarr is offering huge rewards for someone who can bring him esoteric ingredients for his newest restaurant grand opening in 6 months. His last 3 restaurant openings were reviewed horribly saying that they weren't inventive or unique enough, because the reviewer hates him. The reviewer can be persuaded to relax by offering a dish made on Brackish. LeStarr will pay you if you bring him: 1) Papua Fruit Shells from Garish, Giant Mongoose Liver from Dyna, and Sun Cakes from Trin."}
